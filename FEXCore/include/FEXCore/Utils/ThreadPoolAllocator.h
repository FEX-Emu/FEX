 * @brief An intrusive thread pool allocator
 *
 * Requires coordination between the allocator and its clients to efficiently share memory allocations between threads.
 *
 * The `Client` in this case referring to the location in code allocating a `MemoryBuffer` from the allocator.
 *   - The client must `Claim` a buffer to allocate it
 *   - In claiming a buffer, the allocator is passed a `BufferOwnedFlag` that is updated by both the allocator and client.
 *   - When the client is done with the buffer it must `Disown` or `Unclaim` the buffer.
 *     - `Disown` the buffer when it is expected to be used again soon.
 *       - This is relatively cheap.
 *     - `Unclaim` when the buffer won't be used again for an extended period.
 *       - This is expensive and requires a mutex shared between threads
 *     - `PoolBufferWithTimedRetirement` helper class provided to help with this.
 *
 * Once the client has disowned a buffer then the allocator is free to reclaim the buffer when another thread is trying to `Claim` a new buffer.
 * The buffer getting claimed from a disowned client must have had its last use greater than the defined `DURATION` before it has a chance to get
 * reclaimed by the Allocator.
 *
 * During buffer reclaiming is also when unclaimed buffers get freed. This means active threads are able to clean up idle thread's unused memory.

/**
 * @brief Wrapper around the pool allocator for delayed pool reclaiming
 *
 * This is expected to be used in high frequency buffer temporary usage.
 * Instead of quickly unclaiming and reclaiming the buffer while the the code is hot,
 * This instead will do the cheap operation of disowning the buffer until the code path cools down enough.
 * Once the code path stops disowning the codepath more times than `PeriodFrequency` during `PeriodMS` then
 * it will immediately unclaim.
 *
 * Implications:
 *   - The object will always be claimed for at *least* `PeriodFrequency`
 *   - The object will still *always* be disowned after each temporary use
 *     - This allows the pool allocator to reclaim a buffer from a sleeping thread
 *
 * Performance characteristics:
 *  - Disowning is cheap.
 *    - Last-used timestamp update
 *    - atomic_bool clear to signify it is disowned
 *
 *  - Reowning is relatively cheap (When buffer is still owned).
 *    - atomic_bool load to check if the object is still owned
 *      - atomic<uint32_t> CAS to change the object to `OWNED` state
 *        - Resolves a race condition where the `Allocator` can be in the process of reclaiming the buffer from the client
 *      - Last-used timestamp update
 *      - atomic_bool<relaxed> set to signify owned
 *      - atomic<uint32_t> set to change object to `OWNED` state
 *    - When object isn't owned, then allocate a new buffer from the pool
 *
 *  - Unclaiming is fairly costly
 *    - Requires owning a mutex, shared between all threads using the `Allocator`
 *    - Updating two fextl::list containers to give the ownership back to the `Allocator`
 *
 *  - Claiming is very costly
 *    - Requires owning a mutex, shared between all threads using the `Allocator`
 *    - Scans two fextl::list containers to find the best fit buffer
 *    - Or allocates another buffer when that fails
 *    - Frees stale buffers opportunistically
